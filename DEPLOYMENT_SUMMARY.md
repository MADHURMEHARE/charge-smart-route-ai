## 🚀 Next Steps: Complete Your Deployment

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase Database

1. **Create Supabase Project**
   ```bash
   # Go to https://supabase.com and create a new project
   # Note your project URL and anon key
   ```

2. **Run Database Setup**
   ```sql
   -- Copy and run the SQL from supabase/setup.sql in your Supabase SQL Editor
   -- This creates all tables, indexes, and initial data
   ```

3. **Enable Real-time Extensions**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Settings > Database > Extensions
   - Enable the "realtime" extension
   - Verify tables are added to realtime publication

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
VITE_APP_ENV=development
VITE_REALTIME_ENABLED=true
```

### Step 3: Test Real-Time Features

1. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Simulator**
   - Navigate to the Live page
   - Click "Start Simulator" to begin generating test data
   - Watch for real-time updates in the UI
   - Check browser console for connection status

3. **Verify Real-Time Updates**
   - Station status updates every 5 seconds
   - New alerts appear with toast notifications
   - Metrics update in real-time
   - Connection status shows "Connected"

### Step 4: Deploy to Production

#### Option A: Automated Deployment (Windows)
```powershell
# Set environment variables
$env:VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-id.supabase.co"
$env:VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key-here"

# Run deployment script
.\deploy.ps1
```

#### Option B: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy the 'dist' folder to your hosting provider
# Options: Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3, or any web server
```

### Step 5: Connect Real Data Sources

1. **Get API Keys**
   - OpenChargeMap: Free API for global charging stations
   - ChargePoint: Commercial API for US stations
   - Tesla Supercharger: Tesla's network data

2. **Configure API Integration**
   ```bash
   # Add to your environment variables
   VITE_CHARGING_API_URL=https://api.openchargemap.io/v3
   VITE_CHARGING_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Test Real Data**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   import { chargingStationAPI } from './src/services/chargingStationAPI';
   
   // Test nearby stations
   chargingStationAPI.getNearbyStations()
     .then(stations => console.log('Real stations:', stations));
   ```
